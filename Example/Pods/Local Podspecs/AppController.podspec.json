  "summary": "A clean and simple way to manage switching between `logged out` and `logged in` interfaces in iOS, written in Swift.",
  "description": "Modern iOS applications typically provide the ability to login. Many apps implement this lazily by simply presenting a log in sheet above the main apps interface. This project offers a simple controller class that instead manages transitioning to/from the required interface with convenient methods to trigger the desired transition and and hooks to keep you notified of what is happening.",
